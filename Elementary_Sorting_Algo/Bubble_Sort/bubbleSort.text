"Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm
that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each
pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order".

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm for sorting, but itâ€™s also quite inefficient,
as its worst case is O(n^2) complexity.
We loop through an array, and we keep comparing one item to the one right next to it.
If the item on the right is smaller, we swap the two positions.

const bubbleSort = (originalArray) => {
  let swapped = false

  const a = [...originalArray]

  for (let i = 1; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
    swapped = false

    for (let j = 0; j < a.length - i; j++) {
      if (a[j + 1] < a[j]) {
        ;[a[j], a[j + 1]] = [a[j + 1], a[j]]
        swapped = true
      }
    }

    if (!swapped) {
      return a
    }
  }

  return a
}
