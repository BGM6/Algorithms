Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted
position, it places small values into sorted position.

You set a temp min value and you compare it with the other values.
If another value is less than the current min you swap values.
Then you repeat the process with then new temp min to see if there is another
smaller value

[9, 10, 3, 4, 1, 2]
tempMin = 9;
9 is smaller than 10 so no swap
9 is larger than 3 so we swap
