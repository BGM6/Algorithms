//1. Hash Tables (Objects in JS)
/*
-Hash tables are often the best tool to optimize a solution
-Hash tables enable us to write very readable code
-Hash tables are a flexible data structure that allow us to store items using key-value pairs which
are very fast at O(1) time and also make our code more intuitive. If you ever need to optimize a
question, always consider if a hash table could be used
-The downside is that hash tables aren’t (typically) ordered which is why they are often
combined with other data structures.

//2. Arrays
/*
Arrays are linear and indexed. We get fast operations at the
indexes and when we add/remove items from the end.
*/

//3. Recursion
/*
Companies can introduce recursion without it being specifically a “recursion problem”.
For example, depth-first search in graph or tree traversal has an elegant recursive solution,
and it can appear in advanced concepts like dynamic programming. Other common uses for
recursion are binary search, traversing a linked list, or iterating through a stack data structure.

//4. Sorting
//5. Trees
//6. Graphs(and graph Traversal)
//7. Binary Search and O(log n) time

//8. Linked List Techniques
/*
Regardless of your opinion on them, you should understand how they work for interviews,
and the foundation of linked lists are rooted in computer science fundamentals which is
beneficial to anyone in our field.
Luckily the essential concepts for linked lists can be distilled to a few points.
Know how to iterate through a linked list by being given a head node
Delete or insert an item from a linked list
Manage multiple pointers (more on this in the next section)
Implement the runner technique
Common questions: reverse a linked list, delete an item from the tail, find an item, determine
if there are duplicates, determine if there is a cycle, merge multiple linked lists
