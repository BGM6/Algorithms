Shallow copies duplicate as little as possible. A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the
collection structure, not the elements. With a shallow copy, two collections now share the individual elements.

Deep copies duplicate everything. A deep copy of a collection is two collections with all of the
elements in the original collection duplicated.
