1. Devise a plan for solving a problem
2. Master common problem solving patterns

*Understand the problem
    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    4. Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that area part of the problem?

*Explore the concrete examples
    1. Start with simple examples
    2. Progress to more complex examples
    3. Explore examples with empty inputs
    4. Explore examples with invalid inputs


*Break it down
    1. Sudo code write down the steps you'll take
    2. Sudo code will show the interviewer you had an approach even if
        don't finish or get the problem right. It's about the process.

*Solve/simplify
*Look back and refactor
