What are graphs used for?

-The internet, your your facebook friends, IG friends.
-GPS, roads on the map connect to each other. A bunch of nodes connected by roads
-Recommendations use graphs
    'people also watched'
    'you might also like'
    'people you might know'
    'frequently bought with'

Terms to know
*Vortex = a node
*Edge = connection between nodes
*Weighted/Unweighted = values assigned to distances
*Directed/Undirected = directions assigned to distanced between vertices

Types of Graphs
-Undirected Graph
    There is no directions on the edge there is no forward or backwards.
    There is no polarity. It can go either way.
    Example: Facebook friends. I can see my friends content they can see mine.

-Directed Graph
    There is a direction assigned to the edge. You can only go that way can't go back
    Example: Instagram - I follow Rihanna I can see her content. She doesn't follow me she cant see my content.

-Weighted Graphs
    Weighted graphs have values on the edges
    Example: Maps showing distance from vertex to vertex. That shows value on the edge

-Unweighted Graphs
    Have no values on the edges
    Example: Facebook, Instagram.


//Adjacency Matrix
        Takes up more Space in sparse graphs
        Slower to iterate over all edges
        Faster to lookup specific edge
//Adjacency List - can use an array to store or a hash table;
        Can take up less space in sparse graphs
        Faster to iterate over all edges
        Can be slower to lookup Specific edge
